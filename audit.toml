# Cargo Audit configuration
# Justification:
# - RUSTSEC-2025-0052 (async-std discontinued) is introduced via the httpmock dev-dependency.
# - httpmock is used only in test targets to avoid real network calls, never in production binaries or libraries.
# - We track replacing httpmock with a tokio-based alternative or an updated version once available.
# - For now, this advisory is ignored to allow CI quality gates to pass while keeping tests hermetic and offline.
