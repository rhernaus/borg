## Project Overview

Borg is an autonomous agent that can analyze, modify, and improve its own codebase. The system is designed with several core components:

- **Core Agent**: Orchestrates the self-improvement process
- **Ethics Framework**: Ensures all improvements adhere to ethical principles
- **Optimization Goals**: Tracks and prioritizes improvement objectives
- **Authentication System**: Manages access control and permissions
- **Code Generation**: Creates code improvements
- **Testing Framework**: Validates proposed changes
- **Version Control**: Manages code branches and merges
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks system resource usage

## Current Status

The project is fully implemented with all core components working together. The agent can now run and is ready for defining optimization goals.

**Current Version**: 0.1.0
