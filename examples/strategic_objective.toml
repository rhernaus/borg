# Strategic Objectives Configuration Example
#
# This file shows how to define strategic objectives for the Borg agent.
# These long-term goals will guide the agent's planning and improvement activities.
#
# Each objective includes:
# - id: A unique identifier
# - title: A short title
# - description: A detailed description of what to achieve
# - timeframe: Number of months to achieve the objective
# - key_results: Measurable outcomes that indicate success
# - constraints: Boundaries or requirements that must be respected

By 2025, reduce the system's resource footprint by 50% while maintaining or
improving throughput. This will allow deployment on lower-cost hardware and
improve scalability for larger workloads.

  "Process 2x the current transaction volume with same resources"
]

constraints = [
  "Must maintain all existing functionality",
  "Cannot reduce security measures",
  "Must support the same platforms as the current version",
  "Changes must have comprehensive test coverage"
